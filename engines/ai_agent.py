"""The AI Agent: it works an L1 Data Confirming case the way an analyst does,
and hands the case to a person whenever it cannot be sure.

1. Claude reads every document on the case from its image, in one call
   through Straive's LLM Foundry (fincrime/filebook/llm.call): the passport's
   data page and back page, the secondary ID and the proof of address - what
   is printed, whether it can be read, and what spoils the capture.
2. Fixed checks - code, not the model - compare that read with the case:
   readable, name, date of birth, nationality, ID number, expiry, the
   vendor's result, the passport's endorsements, the secondary ID (its name
   and date of birth), the proof of address and its address.
3. Every check passes: the agent confirms the data through the analysts'
   own path (workflow.confirm_data) and the AI screening rules re-run. A
   case they leave nothing on verifies itself; one with a watchlist alert
   left goes to Data Screening, where an analyst clears the alert. Any check
   fails, or Claude cannot be reached: the case stays in Data Confirming,
   labelled human-in-the-loop, with the reasons and what the agent read.
   What the agent settles itself, when nothing else is wrong and nothing is
   left for an analyst: the record's own slips, where the documents agree
   with one another (the father's name kept for the holder's, a married
   surname on the form, an anglicised first name beside the naturalisation
   certificate, a PO Box for a home), it corrects and confirms
   (record_fixes); a proof of address older than six months, the document
   that links two names, or which home is the main one, it asks the
   customer for through the analysts' own Resubmit POA or RFI
   (customer_request). A request approves nothing; what comes back is
   checked again.
4. On a case with a watchlist alert left, the agent also sets what the
   documents say beside each open World-Check record (watchlist_findings):
   a likely true match, a possible one, or likely a different person. It
   informs the analyst; the rules and the analyst decide the alert.
5. Claude's own verdict, a second opinion beside the rules: a text-only call
   gets the read, the customer's record, the bank's document policy and any
   open watchlist record, and answers verify / send to a person with a
   confidence, and whether the documents show the customer is the listed
   person. It is shown and counted (does it agree with the rules?) but never
   acts on the case. It is a separate call so the record cannot leak into
   the read: a hidden date of birth must stay unread, not be filled in from
   the CRM.

It takes individuals in Data Confirming: those the rules cleared (the
auto-verified workflow), and those with an alert left that no person holds
or has worked. A company (KYB) stays with people. The result sits on the
case as case["ai_agent"].
